This is the file that ModpackTweaks reads mod download information from
Addition of mods is very simple, just use 3 lines to put the:
(1) formal name, (2) url, and (3) the mod ID, then a blank line after that, starting the first line after the dashes.
The mod ID must match exactly, check the mcmod.info or source code of the mod in question to find the modid.
